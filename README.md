The local commuter railroad services a number of towns in Kiwiland. Here is a Challenge that
solves some quests.

Tests may run in different order than expected, because of the Order annotation that is still in the experimental state.

*See [Challenge](src/main/resource/Challenge.md) for the details of the tasks.*

## Example implementation
##### Override new input file over: src/main/resource/input.txt
###### Run tests to get the output
```java
public class TrainTest{}
```
